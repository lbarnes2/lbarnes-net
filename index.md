Hi, I'm Luke.

I'm an enthusiast for all things interesting. Molecular Biology graduate from [Cardiff University](http://cf.ac.uk "Cardiff University"), coffee enthusiast, technology nerd, computer tinkerer and professional problem solver. This is a collection of things I've done, projects I've worked on and other things that interest me.

In 2017, I took on a major organisational role on two high profile events.

## Young Inventor of the Year Competition 2018
Working with the Bath Royal Scientific and Literary Institute (BRSLI) to take over full delivery of the Young Inventor competition. This event includes a series of workshops, as well as the main event with judging and award presentation.

## British Orchid Show and Congress 2018
After the success of the British Orchid Congress in 2012, I was asked back to help lead the team organising the 2018 version of this event (now called the British orchid Show and Congress). This event includes hosting over 1000 public visitors over the two day show, plus exhibitors and traders from across Europe.

In the past I've been (I believe, fairly) quite rude about Eurostar. The organisation at St Pancras International is farcical, the queues are long and always seem without reason and both the website and app has a nasty habit of just not working. That said, today I want to put aside all of that to call out some something good.

My last trip with Eurostar was delayed for over an hour.  On returning home I received an email from them. It said four things:

- "Your train was late"
- "You're entitled to compensation"
- "Here's how you claim it"
- "We're sorry"

Not only did they acknowledge the delay, they *reached out to me* to offer me compensation for the trip. They remove all friction with claiming compensation, even giving me the information *in the email* that I need to claim it. And most importantly, they apologised.

In a world where companies try to avoid compensation by brushing it under the rug, hoping you won't know you're entitled to anything or won't bother claiming because it's so laborious, it is almost overwhelmingly refreshing to see a company take the opposite approach. It genuinely has renewed my trust in the company.

So, dear Eurostar (if you're reading this); I will continue to criticise you. I will continue to point out where you don't meet my high expectations. I believe that it's important to hold companies accountable for bad experiences when they occur. But today, thank-you. Know that it is truly and wholly appreciated.

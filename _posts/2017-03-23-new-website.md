New year, new website! Or at least, that was the plan. In reality, I've had a placeholder up at lbarnes.net for the past few months while I get my act together with bits and bobs. But here we are with a shiny new site, using a new blogging engine. All of the new things!

### Bye bye Squarespace
While I've never really had any problems with the old squarespace site, I never really found it to be quite what I was after. For starters, squarespace was **rediculously** powerful compared to what I needed. While this wouldn't usually be a problem, the $8 per month was a drain on finances that I could no longer really justify for a site that is, in the main, a self indulgent project.

Among the reasons that I left [Squarespace](squarespace.com "squarespace") was that I was just plain bored of it. There was nothing new and exciting to play with, no new things to learn. It was also a somewhat clunky experience to write articles on the iPad and then copy paste them into Squarespace's blog app (because that thing isn't optimised for the 12.9" iPad, so spending as little time as possible in it).

In conclusion: Squarespace -\> 👍🏻, but I'm still moving on.

### Hello Jekyll
Years ago, really good friend of mine [Dan Groves](danielgroves.net "Dan's site") was raving to me about how good [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll ") was. At the time, I was still using, and was happy with, [Wordpress](Wordpress.org "Wordpress") for my portfolio[^1]. Years later Dan has long since [moved on](https://danielgroves.net/development/2016/11/move-to-heroku "Dan moves from Jekyll"), but Jekyll stuck in my mind as something to try - so here I am, trying it.

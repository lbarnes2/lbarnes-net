### EMPLOYMENT

- February 2017 - Present: Operations at the [Assembly Rooms, Bath](https://www.bathvenues.co.uk/venues/assembly-rooms "Bath Assembly Rooms")
In early 2017 I moved to work at a much larger event space in the beautiful Georgian Assembly Rooms, run by Bath and North East Somerset Council. I joined a small team keeping the venue to a very high standard and assisting with the delivery of a wide variety of events in the venue's four multifunction spaces.

- June 2015 – February 2017: Venue Manager at the [Victoria Hall, Radstock](http://www.victoriahallradstock.co.uk "Victoria Hall")
I'm delighted to be joining the team working at the Victoria Hall, to develop the venue into a thriving community hub. Duties include recruiting and managing external events and bookings into the venue's 6, multi-functional spaces, developing in-house, "Victoria Hall" branded events, managing the day-to-day running of the venue's coffee bar and increasing public awareness of the venue and it's events. This role also includes a large publicity portion, maintaining Sue Hill Dance LTD's web properties and the venue's presence on social media.

- December 2013 – June 2015: FOH Performance Staff at the [New Theatre, Cardiff](http://newtheatrecardiff.co.uk "New Theatre")
I’ve been working since December as part of the Front of House team at the New Theatre in Cardiff after volunteering there for three months beforehand. Responsibilities include front line customer service such as directing customers and resolving minor problems, as well as sales and cash handling through sales of drinks and confectionery, or work on one of the theatre’s bars.

- June 2011 – August 2014: Technical Manager at the [Prospect Theatre](http://www.writhlington.org.uk/extra-curricular/dragonfly-theatre/ "Not-so-prospect prospect theatre")
Working part time as required at a small professional theatre. Responsibilities include maintenance and development of the theatre’s supply of technical equipment including lighting, sound and AV. This also includes meeting with clients to discuss their technical needs, and providing guest technicians with technical support. Due to the small nature of the venue, I have also stepped in for the Theatre Manager during leave and often take a duty manager role during events.

- Specific Events
I have worked on a number of major events in my time working both at the Prospect and as a freelance technician and events manager. Visit this section for a full list of events, along with groups and venues that I've worked with.
